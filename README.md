# new-portfolio

## Purpose

This is a new portfolio website for my work. 

## Languages used

- HTML: for content
- CSS: I added some custom CSS on top of the framework
- Javascript/JQuery: for animations/parallax

## Libraries used

- [Materializecss] (https://materializecss.com/): This was the primary framework I used for styling the website. This was the first time I used this CSS/Javascript framework. I taught myself how to use it using Youtube and also buy reading through the documentation on the website.

## Ideas for future updates

I am planning on adding more transition animations, and also plan on adding a direct "contact me" functionality.
